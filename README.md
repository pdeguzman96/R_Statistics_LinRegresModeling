# Statistics with R Specialization
## Linear Regression and Modelling 

This repository contains the labs and project I completed while working on this Coursera specialization from Duke University. In the *project* folder, you will find the work I completed for this project in the *reg_model_predict.html* or *reg_model_predict.Rmd*.

Alternatively, you can [click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdeguzman96/R_Statistics_LinRegresModeling/master/project/reg_model_predict.html), right click and Save As HTML, then view my work in your browswer locally.
